## 0.5.0

- Added support for rule-specific custom parameters in `dart_skills_lint.yaml`, allowing rules to be configured with parameter maps (e.g. passing exclusions, thresholds, length limits, etc.).
- Refactored `path-does-not-exist` from an inline structure check into a class-based `SkillRule`, enabling it to be disabled or overridden.
- Exposed namespaced CLI flags for custom parameters (e.g. `--path-does-not-exist-exclude`) with support for empty string overrides to clear parameters.
- Implemented parameter type-coercion for `int`, `bool`, and `List` types parsed from the command line.

### Deprecations & Refactoring

- Refactored `ValidationResult` out of `src/validator.dart` into `src/models/validation_result.dart`. `src/validator.dart` re-exports `ValidationResult` to preserve complete backward compatibility for packages importing internal structure directly.
- Deprecated and transitioned rule configuration concepts across model structures and APIs to use consistent `ruleConfigs` naming, alongside backwards-compatible deprecation shims:
  - Deprecated `Validator` constructor parameter `ruleOverrides` in favor of `ruleConfigs`.
  - Deprecated `Configuration.configuredRules` and `LintTargetConfig.rules` getters in favor of `ruleConfigs`.
  - Deprecated `ValidationSession` constructor parameter `resolvedRules` in favor of `resolvedRuleConfigs`.
  - Deprecated `ValidationSession` method `resolveRulesForPath` in favor of `resolveRuleConfigsForPath`.

## 0.4.0


- Fixed issue #166 by adding support for configuring individual skills via the `individual_skills:` key in `dart_skills_lint.yaml`, enabling path-specific rule severity mapping without relying on root directory scanning.
- Native binaries for macOS arm64, macOS x64, Linux x64, and Linux
  arm64 are now published to GitHub Releases. Install without the
  Dart SDK via `curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash`, or download the
  tarball directly and verify its SHA256.
- macOS binaries are not yet code-signed; clear the
  quarantine flag with
  `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine $(which dart_skills_lint)` on
  first launch.
- The `dart pub global activate dart_skills_lint` and
  `dev_dependencies:` install paths are unchanged.

## 0.3.1

- `--fix` now writes fixes to disk; pair with `--dry-run`
  (`--fix --dry-run`) to preview the proposed diff without writing.
  The legacy `--fix-apply` flag still works but is deprecated and
  emits a notice on stderr.
- Running the CLI with no arguments and no `.claude/skills` or
  `.agents/skills` directory present now prints a short onboarding
  guide explaining how to point the linter at a skill or a skills
  root.
- `description-too-long` errors now report the actual character
  count and show an excerpt with a `|HERE|` marker at the cutoff
  so authors can see exactly where the text went over. The same
  diagnostic shape is now used for the `compatibility` field's
  500-character limit.
- `invalid-skill-name` errors now disambiguate the frontmatter
  `name:` field from the parent directory name, quote the offending
  value, and suggest a normalized form. The directory-mismatch
  error offers both directions of the fix (edit the field or
  rename the directory).
- `check-relative-paths` errors now include the resolved absolute
  path and, when a near-miss filename exists in the same
  directory, surface a `Did you mean "..."?` suggestion that
  preserves the link's directory prefix.
- New `example/` directory with reference `valid` and `invalid`
  skill fixtures and a walkthrough.
- New "Recipes" section in `README.md` with copy-pasteable GitHub
  Actions and pre-commit hook integrations.

## 0.3.0

- Exposed `ConfigParser.loadConfig()` API to load configuration files programmatically.
- Supported tilde expansion (`~/`) in configuration file paths.
- Updated documentation to clarify CLI vs. Dart Test usage.

## 0.2.0

- Refactored validator to a pluggable rule-based architecture.
- Added support for custom rules via `SkillRule`.
- Added runtime assertion for duplicate rule names.
- Added warning when a rule emits an error with severity different from its definition.
- Updated `README.md` with custom rules documentation.
- **Breaking Change**: Enabling a rule via CLI flag now sets its severity to `error` instead of `warning`.

## 0.1.0

- Initial version.
